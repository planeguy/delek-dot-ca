				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is the beginning of chapter two. It still needs a bit of work but I thought that I would post it and then work on it later this week.</p>
<p><em>I wake with a start. My mind races. I can hear the fast thump of my heart radiating out of my chest. A few weeks have passed since I dropped the twins off with Dr. Zinteco. I shake my head hard and try to think of other things but I can’t get their lifeless faces out of my mind. I roll over and the hard mattress on the concrete floor of the abandoned gas station that I am sleeping in feels paper thin. My shoulder grazes the hard surface beneath. I am used to this type of discomfort and never give it much thought but on this misty cold morning I wish I was somewhere warmer. The gas station is on the outskirts of town or in the fringes a half of days walk outside the signal zone. </p>
<p>Today I start planning the long trek to the secret annual upload that all knowledge workers go to once a year and this is my second closest shelter to the east. It isn&#8217;t one of my more permanent places to sleep but it was the closest jumping off point to start my trek. Usually I chose a place in the rain forest further from the signal but before heading to the secret annual upload I had a lingering thought to check on the twins one more time before I headed deeper into the woods so this gas station is my uncomfortable home for the moment. </p>
<p>I had checked in with the Dr. Zinteco last week and he had good news. After three days of working with the twins off grid he managed to jump start them and reload their memories. Two days ago I was able to return the twins to their parents, the proud memory of walking hand in hand with the rambunctious and curious children as they tried to kick, eat or climb everything on the walk back through the city is still fresh in my mind. Full of life they seemed to skip on the walk back. Their small sticky hands in mine as I walked with them and lifted them through the hole in the fence and climbed back up the rusty elevator to meet their parents. The look on Maggie&#8217;s face made all of the risk worth it. The isolation of being a Knowledge Worker and of sleeping hard was worth it in that moment. Me knowing who to contact and how to help the twins made all of the negative parts of who I was disappear in that moment. After a jubilantly tearful hug from Maggie the twins mother I was uncomfortable sharing such a sweet family moment so I simply nodded and headed back outside. I could feel an unusual skip to my step as I glided way. The energy in my step was fueled by the feeling of hope.  </p>
<p>Shaking my head to focus on the day ahead instead of just lying on the hard and cold mattress thinking about the last few weeks I jumped up and shook out my aching shoulder that I had been resting on. Looking around while I shook out my thin mattress I took a minute to appreciate the good view. This old gas station was of the one of ten places I decided upon as a temporary and rotating homes. This far from the city there are usually only small single story buildings dusted grey by the wind storms that whip the dirt and gravel around the unused parking lots. The station was the closest one to the signal line and the one that I felt most uncomfortable in. One of the places that I decided to call home on my ten locations random circuit of places that I have chosen as my temporary places to live. Rotating and never living in the same place for to long was one of the strategies recommended to knowledge Workers. The tactic was used to make sure that we are always on the go and this helps to ensure that we are not found. Being found and erased all of the knowledge that we safeguarded lost is a constant worry along with the personal worry that if we were found we would be interrogated and could give up information and locations of what we knew of other Knowledge Workers. </p>
<p>Time is something I always have plenty of. I could feel my earlier thought that I might have an exciting year slowly slip away as I sat down on the concrete edge of the second floor. At some point in the past the wall had been blown away creating a perfect perch for a look out or when the sun was hitting that corner of the building a perfect place to read. I love to read. My hands carefully cradling the book in my lap. The weight of it felt comforting. It was one of three old paper books that I had. I had read it many times and had it memorized but I love the action of reading and the weight of the book in my hand. Humming softly to myself I could hear the rusty tin sign of the gas station sway gently in the wind along with a bird chirping happily off in the distance. I really did love this small oasis of this location even though the proximity to the city was never far from my mind. Flipping the page I suddenly notice that the bird has gone quiet. Shifting my focus to listening intently I hear footsteps crunch against the gravel. Almost no one would come out this far past the signal. Usually I see one person every month and they are  usually a scavenger. Suddenly one edge and tense I wondered if it was party on patrol – to search for me… laying my book down carefully I jumping up quickly and inched to the blown out windowed on the other side of the room. My first instinct is to hide in the shadow protecting the uncorrupted data in my head. Careful not to step on the remands of the glass shards by the window as I lean closer to the window I look down slowly trying not to bring attention to myself. I let out a small breath when I recognize Dr. Zinteco   </p>
<p>I sneak outside and came up behind him from the opposite direction of the deserted gas station. You can never be too careful and it is always good to cover your tracks… “Hello Dr. Zinteco” I say calmly not wanting to startle him with my sudden appearance.</p>
<p>“Amina” urgently and thankfully he reaches out to clasp my hands and then draws back realizing that I wasn’t used to contact. “I’ve been searching for two days. I’ve been by to see Delek at the community archives hoping that bits of information that I have picked up over the years would lead you to me.” I have a John Doe. Somebody dropped him off outside of the drop box were families, people put the bodies for the sweepers&#8230; I know that we can’t save everyone but I found him before they started their shift at the hospital. He was laying just out of range of the cameras… he trailed off… with the tone of someone who has seen too much and realizes that he is being too hopeful. “I was hoping that you could help.. I know that it’s selfish in asking but there was something about his face that prodded me… a ghost of a memory.” He turned away his old face almost flushed with embarrassment. Looking at him he reminded me of my father.</p>
<p>I reached out almost cringing at the unusual feel of someone’s hand in mine. I grasped his weathered hand briefly and said “I’ll head in to the city 20 minutes after you and meet you at the hospital after nightfall”.</p>
<p>Shaking his head with the usual abrupt strength and assurance that I was used to seeing he said “thank you I always knew that I could turn to you”. He leaned down to tighten the laces on his battered old military issued hiking boots and I took that as my signal to disappear. Gathering up my belongings I waited savoring the rare sound of the bird chirping. Have I lost my marbles? Heading in to the city to help one unknown man.. Risking the safekeeping of the world’s knowledge if I was caught? This definitely went against the Knowledge Workers code of conduct. The part of me that worked to save those little boys, the part of me that my father believed was just as important than the knowledge that we hold, the part that knew that helping an innocent was sometimes worth the risk &#8211; because it is the guiding force that makes us human… In a world where data and information are the most valuable currency and where humanity is somewhat controlled, overlooked or at least dependent on technology I tell myself that it is the gut feeling of knowing the difference between what is right and what is wrong that is important. Maybe it will save humanity. Maybe.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is a very rough draft of my first chapter.. again let me know if you have any ideas of how you want the story to develop. I have been having a lot of fun writing this story. It&#8217;s the first time I have tried young adult fiction with a dystopian tech twist.  </p>
<p><em>In the haze of dusk and fog the city looked like it wasn’t just a skeleton of what once was. Peering over the inlet I could see the city center skyline as I walked. I could imagine gleaming windows in all of the high rises that were now just rusted metal frames and windblown cement. </p>
<p>Years ago it was deemed that the buildings in the core were unstable and families and business moved out. The authorities came in and built small grey block housing in the area surrounding the buildings creating a maze of grey housing to wind through. I could also see the smoke stacks from the refineries dotting the coastline. In return for the monthly uploads and the small drab housing families worked tirelessly at the refineries. There were three huge complexes in the city’s once famous harbour. The refineries pulled the sludgy oil water out of the sea and refined it back into usable oil and with oil being so rare a whole workforce could be tasked with retrieving it. </p>
<p>Working my way down the hill I quickly walked passed the school. Kids still went to school to learn, rules and codes were taught. The government had a hard stance that it couldn’t create memory as part of the monthly upload only maintain the ones that each person naturally developed.</p>
<p>Historians questioned why there was a shift to datapacks. Some thought people did it for job security others thought that maybe people weren’t aware of the risks. A few hundred years ago there was signal everywhere and it would have been so rare to loose connection and be wiped. Maybe nobody knew the risks? And now a a few hundred years later it was just the way things are. The government mandated a datapack implant when you are born and it is never questioned. The datapack comes with a registration in the system and ensures that you are given a job, and have a chance at finding a place to live in the signal areas. Outside of signal areas people see dangerous wastelands. These are places that people are taught to fear. </p>
<p>There were so many unanswered questions of the past. If people still needed to teach and learn and the only benefit historically was to be uploaded with the news and current events why did everyone become dependent on the packs? How the datapacks updated was ridiculously dangerous. They wiped your mind clean for fraction of a second and then they reloaded all of your current memories along with any new news, current events or “societal information” that came with the monthly upload. But If you weren’t “connected” or within the range of the signal each month when they updated you were lost &#8211; your mind wiped. There were definite benefits to being connected but they came at a high risk.     </p>
<p>I could feel my legs ache as I hurried by the institutionally white cement school that seemed to stand out like an enormous ugly bright box even on a misty night. Usually at least half of the fifteen hundred high school aged kids voices would be echoing off the side of the building but now it was eerily silent. My eyes focusing on the entrance for a second. Less than two years ago when I was a student here in grade eleven. Awkwardly tall, quiet and pretending to try and fit in while trying to hide the fact that I was a Knowledge Keeper. Memories innocently fluttered through my brain of my time in school especially the peace that I found on the virtual running club. Suddenly my memories skipped to a darker place as my mind flashed to why I left school in grade eleven, of Jack, my brother being taken and what was left of our family moving to the Fringes. Shaking my head quickly to dispel painful memories of the past I concentrated on moving quickly and stealthy towards the hospital. I could feel the sweat start to build at the small of my back. The weight of the boys becoming noticeable.</p>
<p>Continuing on the long fast walk I knew that part of the flushed heat I could feel in my muscles came from nerves. I was definitely taking a risk. As a Knowledge Keeper getting caught by the guards was very bad. I was putting all of the knowledge that I was safeguarding at risk. Finally I was approaching the city center and began passing by the grey cubes and began weaving in and out of short block like complexes. </p>
<p>The smell of dinner wafting from most windows caught my attention. My stomach was growling as I weaved towards a back ally to avoid a checkpoint. Along with the quiet growling of my stomach I could hear a yelling match between a guard and a frustrated man on his way home from work. Ducking quickly into the next door to avoid attention I found my self standing in what looked like the storeroom of a pub. Thinking of making a beeline through and out the front door before anyone noticed that I was there I slowly walked to the door that lead into the front room. The sound of music, and the smell of smoke burned my eyes a bit as I peered around the corner to see it was a straight path to the front door. “Dammit” I muttered under my breath as I noticed that there was guard at the front door checking credits and scanning for IDs. Best to lay low and not draw any attention to myself until the morning, I  laid the boys down beside me carefully cradling their heads as I rested them against each other. Putting my thin black jacket on top of them I hunkered down in the corner resting my back to the cold wall to wait out the night. </p>
<p>After a few minutes I could feel my heart beat slow down and I let out a quiet sigh finally getting comfortable with the silence around me. Less than a few heart beats after that the wooden door to the storeroom opened half way. I could see a shadowy figure stepping in. Jumping up silently ready to fight adrenaline fueled as my eyes sharply focusing in the dark room around me. I could feel my guard go down a bit when when I noticed tired and panicked eyes looking back at me. Without words the mysterious person signals that he is in hiding too. Maybe he entered the pub for a drink before the guard settled into do a spot check for the night?</p>
<p>His agile body easily slides slowly down the wall beside where I was originally sitting. His voice whispers “looks like we have a long night ahead of us.” He knowingly looks toward the door. I can tell by the twinkle now in his eye that he presumes that I am hiding because I was caught drinking under the age. With my softly fringed bangs and tall lanky limbs I definitely look younger than I am. I know that it looks like I am younger than nineteen. I can feel whoever he is studying me closely. Looking up his eyes seem to be encouraging me to slide back down and sit beside him. Thinking of protecting the twins from his view I lower myself against the wall. I can feel my arm lightly brush his as I slide down to sit beside him. I try not to finch as a jolt of energy runs between us. We sit in complete silence for a few minutes. I can feel a buzz of energy in my stomach. It probably because I am not used to being this close to anyone. I try to rationalize my feelings and keep my breathing steady and calm. </p>
<p>Suddenly I feel his body tense as he notices the slight sound that the boys are making as they breathe. Before he panics and draws attention to us I slowly pull the jacket down so he can see their faces partially hidden in their hoodies. Unexpectedly my body brushes his as he reaches over to gently move the hair away from their eyes and uncover their vacant stare.“Are they yours?” he asks with strangle intent curiosity. </p>
<p>“No. I’m helping a friend” I reply. Hesitant to give away too much information. As I speak my words came out fast almost awkwardly. As a Knowledge Keeper I’m never around people. Never touched. And now I’m sitting in a dark room next to a mysterious person. I don’t even know his name and I am hesitant to ask and have to share mine. I’m definitely out of my comfort zone and I can feel my stomach tense. I feel shaken up and off kilter.</p>
<p>It looks like a depth of understanding and compassion flashes through his eyes as he listens to my stumbling short answer. I wait but he asks no follow up questions. Instead just nods as a way to end the conversation. We sit there both of our backs pressed against the cold wall. I can feel the hours go by in comfortable silence. The energy continues to buzz between us but I am strangely comfortable in his presence even though I&#8217;m hyper focused on the feeling from his arm as it ever so lightly rests against mine.</p>
<p>Suddenly I hear a voice approaching the other side of the door. I am sure it’s the guard. “I’ll just do a sweep of the place and I’ll call it a night.” The door springs open before we can react or get ready for a fight. </p>
<p>To hide the twins and confuse the guard I see the stranger beside me rip his shirt off over his head, leans in towards me and whispers “trust me”. His body suddenly over mine leaning at an angle to both hide me and block the line of sight to the twins. Holding himself and leaning towards me sideways our bodies never come into contact. I can just feel the warmth from his skin lingering in the air above me.</p>
<p>He suggestively shouts “oh darling” Like we are being romantic and seemingly ready to hastily undress.</p>
<p>I can hear the guard laugh suggestively. “I’ll leave you at it but it’s closing time in ten minutes” he sneers lewdly. The mysterious person thanks the guard with a careless wave of a man with other things on his mind. A few seconds later the door snaps shut behind the guard.</p>
<p>With the bang of the door I freeze. Stunned. Confused. I can feel his lips pull slowly away from where they hovered over my mouth. He moves his head up and lightly brushed my forehead tenderly with his lips. Leaning close as if he could feel my body humming. The energy, the attraction the stunned confusion. I looked up at his face to see a look of a man trying to savor a special moment but maybe I’m mistaken. As soon as he sees my eyes on him the tender moment is over and his eyes fill with the same carefree, twinkle that I had seen when he first sat down beside me. </p>
<p>“We have around eight minutes until the guard comes back. He’ll probably be one of the last ones here. I’ll go ahead and cause a distraction. Give me three minutes and then head straight out the main entrance. It’s to the left”. The tone of his voice is carefree mirroring the twinkle in his eyes but his words spoken feel like they are spoken like a man who methodically assesses a situation and could find a solution to any problem. </p>
<p>I am used to working on my own and following my own lead out of habit. I can feel the automatic response as my head starts to shake. I’m sure that he could see a fiery glint of self-reliance coming to my eyes but I glance down at the two young twins &#8211; their lives depending on my actions and I stop the refusal that was on the tip of my tongue.  Partly because this man has just saved me from being discovered by the authorities and partly because I am still shaken by the energy I think I could feel between us. I nod quickly reaching down for the twins and covering them up the best that I can with my jacket. I moved to the right of the door and hide out of the line of sight as he opens the store room door – the three minutes were forever as I wait. It feels like the longest in my life. I stand there questioning my latest decisions. Worrying what this mysterious person might do. Was he violent? Would he kill the guard? A million scenarios flash through my mind. Along with the worry comes an odd sense of being alone. I could feel my body missing the comforting feeling of being almost pressed against his – a shiver goes through me – before I quickly dismiss such impractical thoughts. With my line of work I cant afford to have even fleeting feelings like that.</p>
<p>Holding my breath I internally count to the three minute mark. I crawl over to the two small lifeless bodies and pick them up. I cradle them against my chest and as silently as I can I swing the door quietly open and made my way to the front door. </p>
<p>The mysterious persons voice washes over me as I slide past. It matched the care free twinkle that I had seen in his eyes minutes earlier. He is perched carelessly on a stool beside the guard. I can tell he is filling the gaurd in with lewd details of his tryst in the back room. My ears burn and I hold back a gasp as I listen to his description of the make out session that he is describing to the guard. Luckily as I get out to the street his boisterous voice begins to fade away.  </p>
<p>Looking back I catch one last look at the mysterious person who is providing cover for me. His actions saved the twins and made it so that I could continue on my quest to smuggle them to the local hospital for an emergency upload. Meeting him there, him not turning both me and the twins in, hiding us from view and then distracting the guard as we escaped &#8211; all of the decisions he had made had worked to protect the knowledge stored in my head and save the twins life tonight. Whoever he was I felt thankful. I felt like luck was on my side. I felt a sharp pang of hope for the recovery of the small boys in my arms. Looking up into the hazy sky, lost in thought, I could see the beginnings of a sunrise. Thankfully I was only a few minutes from the old industrial block of building that held the hospital.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first thing that comes to my mind when I think of visiting San Francisco is Alcatraz. Maybe I have watched too many old crime movies or seen The Rock too many times as a teen. I have always wanted to go and visit and see how they have &#8216;turned&#8217; a prison into a museum or historic visitor attraction. I did a bit of searching online and found this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.parksconservancy.org/visit/tours/alcatraz.html">http://www.parksconservancy.org/visit/tours/alcatraz.html</a></p>
<p>And even thought the site that they linked to looked a bit cheesy</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alcatrazcruises.com/website/pprog-evening-programs.aspx">http://www.alcatrazcruises.com/website/pprog-evening-programs.aspx</a></p>
<p>I decided that it was definitely the way to go because proceeds from the Alcatraz Night Tour support preservation and restoration projects on Alcatraz and throughout the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy. This non-profit organization partnering with the National Park Service and Presidio Trust, the Conservancy has provided over $300 million in support to the Golden Gate National Parks, rallied more than 250,000 volunteers, and pioneered innovative park stewardship and education programs. I looked into their volunteer program and I was tempted to just move to San Francisco &#8211; I have a soft spot for non-profits like this.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is the intro for my novel. I really enjoyed writing it. I appreciate any comments and suggestions that you have. Where do you want the story to go? Help me decide what to write and how the story will end.</p>
<p><em>              Sitting on the top floor of what was rumored to be the city library before data packs became popular and reading was phased out l was distracted by the light stench of rotten paper… although it has been many years since there was more than a torn book cover decaying in the corner the buildings lack of fresh air and lonely ambiance conjured the stench of decay. Breathing deeply and shaking my head to regain focus I continued to listen to Maggie’s story.</em></p>
<p><em>The light from the dust covered windows seeps into the space slowly making it hard to see through the darkness. I could see that Maggie had used the skeletons of two metal shelves to convert a space far from the windows into a home. Beside where she stood there was a beautifully carved wooden bed frame. The natural newness of such a precious piece of furniture seemed at odds with the metal and glass of the rest of the building. Nestled together on the bed lay two almost lifeless boys. Their chests moving slowly up and down in an automatic rhythm separated from any conscious effort of the brain.</em></p>
<p><em>“So after the mandatory monthly upload they simply fell to the floor? And haven’t been responsive yet?” I checked in with a soft voice.</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes” Maggie sobbed. “I told Herald when we moved in that we were at risk living here. It is just on the other side of the no signal signs… Herald said that if we stayed on the top floor we would be fine.” Grasping my hand she continued. “When I found the boys lifeless on the floor I knew it was because they somehow missed their upload… they lost connection. Can you help them Amina?” Maggie asked. “I was friends with your father and for some reason like a lingering thought in the back of my head I always knew to seek your family out in times of trouble. Although I can’t really put my finger on why&#8230;” She trailed off as if lost in a spider web of different thoughts.</em></p>
<p><em>“I can take them to the hospital on the west side. I know a doctor there that won’t report immediately. At least it will give us a chance to save them. Maybe hardline them or figure out what else has gone wrong… Get them better before the sweepers come by at the end of the week.” As I mentioned the sweepers a hard edge grated my curtly reassuring voice. Visions of my past crept loudly through my mind. Visions of my brother being taken away by the sweepers because his mind hadn’t survived the monthly update. Our father’s desperate shout of anguish filled my mind along with an image of our mother struggling defiantly as she was held back by two burly guards from the authorities.</em></p>
<p><em>Shaking my head I knew that we needed to act fast. The boys only had a week at best before it was too late. The faster I could get them to the hospital and convince Dr. Medici to hardline the upload the better chance to boys had in making a full recovery. If they were found unresponsive they would definitely be swept especially since the family had decided to squat outside of the no signal signs. I didn’t know why they made that choice? Maybe to save money to build a better future, maybe for a little sense of freedom that comes from stepping over the line and out of the system?</em></p>
<p><em>“It’s safer if I take them alone”. I tuned to Maggie for her nod of approval before I scooped up the first small body and then the second. My hands full with the boys, maybe three years old, each with their heads rested on my shoulders. Their small lifeless faces hidden in their hoodies. Maggie gave them each one last fiercely loving kiss on the forehead before she turned away. I glanced at her face as she turned and saw the uncomfortable look desperate hope.</em></p>
<p><em>I stared down the still and rusted escalator. Once outside the looming dusk and fog from the ocean a few blocks away hid my figure as I walked with quick purpose towards the west end…</em></p>

<p>This year I am &#8211;</p>
<p>Writing a novel&#8230;</p>
<p>Taking a course&#8230;</p>
<p>Planning a trip&#8230;</p>
<p>I recently started writing a novel. I have just posted the introduction for you to check out.I appreciate any comments and suggestions that you have. Where do you want the story to go? Help me decide what to write and how the story will end.</p>
<p>I am also taking a course (I love school&#8230;) in Information, Access and Protection of Privacy. It&#8217;s definitely more interesting then it sounds. And I&#8217;m looking forward to exploring some of the concepts from the class as I write.</p>
<p>And everyone loves to travel right? I usually try to plan one adventurous trip a year… Last year it was a trip to Scotland which was full of wonderful people, mysterious historic sites, castles, food and distillery tours. This year? I am thinking of San Francisco… I have always wanted to visit Alcatraz and zoom around the city on a trolley.</p>
